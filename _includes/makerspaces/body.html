  Places where individuals who are interested in the creation, design, and fabrication of new objects come together with the design software, manufacturing tools, and integrated control systems and build things that serve a purpose. At UT Austin, these spaces are being re-envisioned and integrated into the fabric of the engineering student experience. But the beauty of makerspaces is that they welcome people from many different disciplines and interests with an interest in understanding a need, designing a product that addresses that need, and iterating the design and building through feedback from the community for whom it is intended as a solution. Indeed it is that attention to empathy, sharing and understanding the feelings that needs of others, that transforms something built into a solution that is needed and wanted.

  Makerspaces provide the ideal intersection of insight, learning, theoretical knowledge and physicality of tangible solutions that allow faculty to see the understanding their students have acquired. As a result, they provide a laboratory for describing the integration of competencies that students need in the creation of a product. These competencies can be described, assessed, and acknowledge with the marker of achievement, a badge, that is tied to a rubric, and the evidence anyone who wishes can see and examine to understand the nature of the competency that is recognized. It is an elegant way to make learning visible and communicate it to others.
